### User Controls (Cole)
The user can specify launch position, launch velocity, and mass of balls. The user can also specify the number of rings, number of sides, and radius of the spiderweb. Finally, launch a ball with / using gravity simulated with verlet integration.\
The balls currently in use are kept track of with an array in its own class, and movement is made with verlet integration. Note that changing parameters of the spiderweb will reset everything in the scene.\
The control panel displays important stats that update with each frame update. The buttons are color-coded with their functionalities.
